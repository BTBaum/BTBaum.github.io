	                    <h4>
	                       Colon Hydrotherapy is putting warm and filtered water into the large intestine to remove waste with no chemicals or drugs.
							 This softens and loosens the waste so it can leave the body thru a normal release process.
							 The process of water in and waste out is done several times during a relaxed and private session with your therapist who is there, at all times, to guide you.
	                    </h4>
	                    <h3>From Ancient to Modern</h3>
						<h4>
							Cleansing the bowel is an ancient therapy, dating back some 5,000 years, where the process of both enemas and laxative use were described in Egyptian and Hindu medical writings. Hippocrates, the famous Greek Doctor and the “Father of Medicine” in 400 B.C. left many writings behind referring to the various inventive ways of cleaning the intestines.
							<br \>
							<br \>
							In the mid 1800’s, further advancements in technology inspired the development of “Colonic Machines”. In the 1900’s, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, (of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes) ran a “sanitarium” (now could be considered a health retreat or destination spa) where he treated thousands of people for a variety of ailments. During the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, colon cleansing devices introduced technology that drastically changed the modality. Instrumentation now included water pressure and temperature monitoring and control, where the water did not just run in an out but had a chance to linger in the colon for the purpose of hydration.<br/>
						</h4>
						<br/>
						<h4>This brought about four significant developments:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A slow gentle administration of filtered water into the bowel was effective and able to cleanse the entire length of the large intestine all the way to the cecum.</li>
							<li>Because low amounts of water were being introduced, balances within the bowel were much less likely to be disrupted.</li>
							<li>Water was now able to gently enter the bowel and “seep” into the “nooks and crannies” allowing the water to soften and loosen hardened feces.</li>
							<li>By changing the water temperature during the course of the session, they were now able to stimulate the muscles of the bowel itself, thus creating a toning effect, which eliminated the possibility of dependency on colonics.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>
							Now the process includes a small disposable speculum, a water line and a waste line. All single client use! So, with this new breed of instrumentation, modern professional colon hydro-therapy was born and the benefits are being recognized by people all over the globe.

											<h3>Benefits</h3>
											<h4>
												 A Fresh Start – Many clients report that colon hydrotherapy helps them start fresh on their new goals for eating better, exercising, weight loss or detoxifying their body. They know it is not a quick fix but a valuable tool in combination with good eating and exercise habits.
											<h4>
											<h4>
												A Healthier Colon – Everything we eat has to be taken into the body or it has to be eliminated. When you eliminate waste with colon hydrotherapy the bowel works more efficiently. The source of many diseases is eliminated by getting rid of the waste and allowing our food to be better absorbed. Healthy means you can feel more energetic, restored and alive.
											</h4>
											<h4>
												Good Bacteria Thrive – How can good bacteria thrive in the colon when the waste is stuck on the colon wall? When gut bacteria is out of balance not only is your digestion and feeling of well-being compromised, so is your immune system that defends against serious illness and disease. With a clean colon the friendly bacteria can live and therefore inhibit the disease causing bacteria to be kept in check.
											</h4>
											<h4>
												Prevent Toxin Build Up – Stagnation is prevented so that harmful agents and end products of digestion can be moved out of the body along with gas, toxic compounds, impurities, mucus and waste. The goal is a healthy and clean colon which should improve our overall health and increase our energy levels by getting rid of toxins. The organs outside of the large intestine that help us get rid of toxins are the liver, lungs and kidneys. When colon hydrotherapy flushes out the toxins along with the waste in the bowel our body detoxifies quicker than our organs would do alone. Also, when the colon is stagnant, the body stores these toxins as they aren’t getting out thru regular bowel movements.
											</h4>
											<h4>
												Absorbing Nutrients – The bacteria in the cecum (first part of the colon) is responsible for the synthesis of vitamin k, most of the B vitamins and others, documented in research articles. The water soluble vitamins are absorbed by the colon. Since our body directly absorbs the nutrients and vitamins in the colon, it is important to keep our colons clean so all these life supporting processes can take place. If you spend money on whole food vitamins, you definitely don’t want to prevent their absorption with a stagnant colon.

	                    <h3>What to Expect and Preparing for Your Visit</h3>
	                    <h4>Before Your First Visit</h4>
						<h5>
							Please fill out the client questionnaire a couple days before your appointment. Pay attention to your body as you prepare to fill out the form, as there might be some questions you have never thought of.
							Do not take any laxatives to get a “head start” as this will dehydrate your body and I need to see the contents of the colon as it is.
							Please only eat fish, seafood, vegetables and fruits for the twenty four hours before your appointment.  That means no bread, dairy, cheese or grains.
							Write down any questions or concerns you might have concerning your therapy. The more we communicate about your personal health the better I can personalize things to better help you.
							Download and print our <a href="http://www.acupunctureforsouthernliving.com/Patient_Intake_Form-Lord.pdf">Client Questionnaire.</a>
						</h5>
	                    <h4>Day of Your Appointment</h4>
						<h5>
							The following are suggestions to help you have the most comfortable and relaxing experience with colon hydrotherapy.
							<br />
							<br />
							Bring your completed intake form, any written down questions and a list of current medications with you.
							<br />
							<br />
							Right when you wake up, drink a full glass of water with a little lemon to wake up your colon. You can eat a meal three hours before your visit. Remember, veges and fish and not rich, fried, spicy or heavy foods which could cause stomach upset. Limit water intake – one hour before your visit. If you have low blood sugar issues, a plant based protein shake two hours before might help.
							<br />
							<br />
							Physical stress, immediately before or after your session, is not suggested. So, set aside enough time so that you are not rushing to and from your visit, if possible.  This is a spa day for your gastrointestinal tract and internal organs. Heading back to work or home is fine but not to the gym. Afterwards, you might have extra energy, or you might feel a little tired due to getting rid of toxins.
							<br />
							<br />
							Please be on time for your appointment, so that you get the full time of your session. When you make an appointment, please understand that time has been reserved for you. There is scheduled time before and after the session to talk about your progress toward meeting your health goals.
