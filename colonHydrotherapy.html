	    	Colon Hydrotherapy
From Ancient to Modern
Cleansing the bowel is an ancient therapy, dating back some 5,000 years, where the process of both enemas and laxative use were described in the oldest known medical texts of the Hindu Vedas. Dating back 3,000 years ago, the “Ebers Papyrus” was an Egyptian document which recorded medical practices dealing with bowel conditions and the practice of colon levage and laxative herbs used to clean the colon. Hippocrates, the famous Greek Doctor and the “Father of Medicine” in 400 B.C. left many writings behind referring to the various inventive ways of cleaning the intestines. 
In the 17th century enemas became very popular. Things went to extremes as many people had two to three enemas a day, fluids with colors and fragrances were all the rage. Many famous French kings, as Louis XIII and Louis XIV were ardent supporters and joined in the enema popularity. 
In the mid 1800’s, further advancements in technology inspired the development of “Colonic Machines”. While the mechanics may have changed, the overall method did not. Large amounts of water, contained in various elevated containers, were introduced in the bowel thru now rubber tubes. 
In the 1900’s, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, (of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes) ran a “sanitarium” (now could be considered a health retreat or destination spa) where he treated thousands of people for a variety of ailments. He reported in the 1917 Journal of American Medicine, that in over 40,000 cases as a result of diet, exercise and enemas, in all but twenty cases, he had used no surgery for the treatment of gastrointestinal disease in his patients.  Dr. Henry A. Cotton, in the 1930’s, published several articles in the Journal of American Medicine that discussed the use of colon cleansing and its successful outcomes. Colonics were widely popular but many of the doctors, who were strong proponents of colonics, also expressed basically the same concerns. Enemas or colonics will not cleanse the entire length of the bowel. Large amounts of water will disturb the “friendly” flora, as well as the electrolyte balance of the gastrointestinal tract or colon. The bowel could become as dependant on colonics as it would on laxatives.
During the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, colon cleansing devices introduced technology that drastically changed the modality. Instrumentation now included water pressure and temperature monitoring and control, where the water did not just run in an out but had a chance to linger in the colon for the purpose of hydration.
This brought about four significant developments:
A slow gentle administration of filtered water into the bowel was effective and able to cleanse the entire length of the large intestine all the way to the cecum.
Because low amounts of water were being introduced, balances within the bowel were much less likely to be disrupted.
Water was now able to gently enter the bowel and “seep” into the “nooks and crannies” allowing the water to soften and loosen hardened feces.
By changing the water temperature during the course of the session, they were now able to stimulate the muscles of the bowel itself, thus creating a toning effect, which eliminated the possibility of dependency on colonics.
Equally significant was the invention of the dual hose delivery system and uniquely designed speculum. The administration of water now includes a small speculum, a water line and a waste line. Sanitization and cross contamination issues were virtually eliminated. So, with this new breed of instrumentation was the birth of modern “Professional Colon Hydro-therapy” and with it, a plethora of benefits are being recognized by people all over the globe.
What Is It and How Does It Work
Colon hydrotherapy is putting warm, filtered water into the rectum and colon in an effective and relaxing way. There are no drugs or chemicals introduced.  In a safe and relaxed environment, the client lies on a padded treatment table and the therapist gently inserts a soft and small silicone speculum into the rectum while keeping the client’s modesty in mind. All of this is disposable – one person use! The therapist is there the whole time to monitor the temperature and pressure of the filtered water entering and leaving the body while gently massaging the abdomen during the release phase so that old waste can be eliminated. The client can relax and easily communicate to the therapist so that the whole of the colon is completely hydrated and cleaned. This closed system method not only hydrates the colon with warm triple filtered water but allows waste material to be eliminated thru the instrument and into the drain lines. This prevents any offensive odor or liquid on the client while maintaining personal privacy.
Benefits 
This is not a medical procedure so I am not allowed to make any claim of benefits. However, colon hydrotherapy may offer relief from a variety of issues such as gas, bloating, abdominal discomfort, constipation, and many other symptoms associated with intestinal problems that affect our overall health. Many clients report that colon hydro-therapy helps them start fresh on their new goals for eating better, exercising, weight loss or detoxifying their body.
As a nurse, I think people are empowered by knowledge and can then make the changes they desire. What better way to take responsibility of your health than by understanding the anatomy of the body and learning how things work.
 Your colon is about five and a half feet long and about three inches in diameter. When the small intestine meets the large intestine this is the widest part of the colon where many things take place. The fluid from the small intestine goes into the cecum (the first part of the large intestine) where it is very nutrient rich. Vitamins B and K are mostly absorbed here and because it is so rich with nutrients most parasites will live in this part of the colon. The appendix also comes in at the bottom of the cecum and is now thought to generate and secrete a powerful germicidal fluid which gets squirted into the cecum if the waste material coming in from is potentially harmful. So, it is the first line of defense to neutralize harmful residue that could interfere with the body’s health. If waste backs up here (common as it is the furthest part of the colon from the rectum) and the individual becomes constipated, then the residue can ferment and putrefy. The appendix can become overworked as it is at the bottom of this area. So, the goal of the closed system colon hydro-therapy is for the warm and filtered water to reach this often overworked and clogged part of the large intestine. If you remember the ancient practice of enemas you can understand the difference. With most enemas, the water enters mostly the rectum and last part of the colon and for a shorter time. The body’s natural response is to get rid of anything in the rectum. The closed system for colon hydro-therapy allows for greater therapeutic benefit as the water slowly enters the whole of the colon, even to the cecum, that so needs a good washing to get rid of the sludge and impurities. The colon is not smooth but has “sac-like” pouches called Haustra that create a “scalloped” shape of the colon. The musculature of these Haustra dilate and contract, allowing the liquid from the small intestine to be passed in an outward movement throughout the entire bowel. All these pouches can have years and years of material that has built up sort of like sludge in a sewer line so that the tissue of the colon is covered with it.  If this waste takes too long to exit the body, the toxins in it can be reabsorbed back into the body. So, just like a glass with dried on material the colon can benefit from this warm water to dissolve the layers of debris that is present and usually takes several “washings” in order to soften it. In that way the colon can do what it was meant to do, which is to clean itself by getting rid of this softened waste. The colon should be healthy, muscular, soft and pliable to move things along efficiently. In order to have good health, we not only need to eat quality food but have healthy and complete elimination.
With a closed system machine, the client will actually get hydrated instead of dehydrated which can occur after traditional enemas. Everyone knows the benefits of hydration to the body and especially with water. As we can see, there is a new million dollar business providing bottled water.  People who have chronic sluggish bowels will feel the difference as not only their colon becomes hydrated but also as their body becomes more hydrated. The benefits of hydration are many, as the body is made up of 55 to 65% water. 
An article from the American Cancer Society on colorectal cancer reads – “it is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered separately, and the second leading cause when both sexes are combined. Overall, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 20 (5%). The death rate from colorectal cancer has been dropping in both men and women for more than 20 years. There are a number of likely reasons for this. One is that polyps are being found by screening and removed before they can develop into cancers. Screening is also allowing more colorectal cancers to be found earlier when the disease is easier to cure.” There is now increasing use of colon hydro-therapy for colonoscopy preps by the gastroenterologist. As the colon is cleaner, it can be seen by the physician. When he sees the actual colon tissue, instead of debris, then polyps and any kind of abnormal tissue can actually be seen. Any needed intervention such as a biopsy or removal can then take place. Many clients can’t tolerate the normal bowel prep, so they stop taking all that is prescribed and go in to the test with a dirty colon. Usually the doctor and staff figure this out when they are already into the procedure.
From the Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology in an article titled “Epidemiology and Burden of Chronic Constipation” it is reported that constipations affects up to 27% of the population. “Constipation is physically and mentally troublesome for many patients, and can significantly interfere with their daily living and well-being. Although only a proportion of patients with constipation seek medical care, most of them use prescribed or over-the-counter medication to improve their condition. The health care costs of constipation are significant as evidenced by the hundreds of million dollars spent yearly on laxatives alone.” 
It further states “Chronic constipation is an important component of clinical gastroenterology practice worldwide. Based on the definition, either self-reported or using Rome criteria, chronic constipation can affect from 2% to 27% of the population. Because constipation is more common in older patients and life expectancy is increasing, an increase in the prevalence of constipation is expected in the years to come, with the associated impact on quality of life and socioeconomic burden. Functional gastrointestinal diseases (FGIDs), including chronic constipation (CC), are among the most frequent illnesses seen by gastroenterologists and account for up to one-half of patient care time. CC is a remarkably common and costly condition that can negatively impact the quality of life, and result in a major social and economic burden.” More can be read at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206560.
Remember that laxatives put chemicals into our body and just remove current waste. Colon hydrotherapy is warm and filtered water which can soften and remove months to years old metabolic waste material. Since it has taken years to get to such a point of chronic constipation it can’t be expected to clear up with one session. This is why multiple sessions of five or six is usually needed to see the needed results. Remember, the dried debris on the glass that needs time to soak in order to let go. 
Hopefully, with periodic cleansing of this incredible part of the body, stagnation is prevented so that harmful agents and end products of digestion can be moved out of the body along with gas, toxic compounds, impurities, mucus and waste. The goal is a healthy and clean colon which should improve our overall health and increase our energy levels.
Hydro-san Machine Benefits
The machine used at Integrated Body Health, is manufactured by Specialty Health Products and is state of the art. There is a triple filtration system on both the hot and cold water line coming out of the machine before going to the client. The goal is achieved to not introduce any harmful items that might be in our tap water into the body. It has medical quality connections and supply lines so it is a medical grade machine. They have also developed and patented a soft, silicone speculum that helps this to be a painless session. The speculum is attached to a soft, light and corrugated hose that carries all the waste out and this goes thru a viewing tube for the therapist and client to view what is leaving the body. It is very important for the therapist to know what is going on in each person’s individual digestive system. This goes into a drain directly, so there is no odor and all waste is in a closed system. This system requires a knowledgeable therapist that can coach the client thru the session which gives opportunity for questions and education about the colon and health. It also allows the therapist to massage the abdomen lightly during the elimination parts of the emptying cycle so the colon gets some help on loosening up any dried on debris. It also allows a therapist to insert the speculum and not the client blindly inserting a tube into their rectum by themselves. Many things affect our colon whether it is diet, elimination patterns, stress, emotions and hydration. In a trusting environment these things can be shared as the client prefers, so that the therapist is aware and can understand accordingly.
