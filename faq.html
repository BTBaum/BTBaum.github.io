                    <h2 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <h3>What is the process?</h3>
                      <p>The machine used at Integrated Body Health is the Hydro-San that is manufactured by Specialty Health Products. It is a Class II FDA listed machine. There is a triple filtration system on both the hot and cold water line before going to the client. The goal is achieved to not introduce any harmful items into the body that might be in our tap water. It has medical quality connections and supply lines so it is considered medical grade. The small speculum is attached to a soft, light and corrugated hose that carries all the waste out. This goes directly into a drain, so there is no odor. This closed system requires a knowledgeable therapist that can coach the client thru the session which gives opportunity for questions and education about the colon and health. It also allows the therapist to massage the abdomen lightly during the elimination part of the emptying cycle to help on loosening up any dried on debris. It also allows a therapist to insert the speculum and not the client blindly inserting a tube into their rectum by themselves. Many things affect our colon whether it is eating habits, elimination patterns, stress, emotions and/or hydration. In a trusting environment these things can be shared as the client prefers, so that the therapist is aware and can understand accordingly.</p>

                    <h3>Is it sanitary?</h3>
                      <p>At Integrated Body Health we have high standards of cleanliness. After each client, the outside of the machine, therapy table and bathroom is sanitized. We focus on a safe, clean and spa environment for your time here.</p>

                    <h3>What is the difference between colonics and colon hydrotherapy?</h3>
                      <p>Colonics were widely popular in the 1940’s but many of the doctors, who were strong proponents of colonics, also expressed basically the same concerns. Enemas or colonics will not cleanse the entire length of the bowel. Large amounts of water will disturb the “friendly” flora, as well as the electrolyte balance of the gastrointestinal tract or colon. The bowel could become as dependant on colonics as it would on laxatives. If you remember the ancient practice of enemas, you can understand the difference. With most enemas, the water enters mostly the rectum and last part of the colon and for a shorter time. The body’s natural response is to get rid of anything in the rectum. The closed system for colon hydro-therapy allows for greater therapeutic benefit as the water slowly enters the whole of the colon, even to the cecum, that needs a good washing to get rid of the sludge, impurities and possible parasites.</p>

                    <h3>Will Colon Hydrotherapy Help Me Lose Weight?</h3>
                      <p>It can help you get a start on weight loss. There can be 10 – 15 pounds of impacted waste material in the pocket like anatomy of the colon. Colon hydrotherapy can help you get rid of this waste but the weight loss is not loss of body mass such as fat. Good eating habits are suggested that are a life style change, not a diet. Certain cookbooks and guidelines are recommended to help you make better food decisions. An appointment with a physician that can determine if you have any food allergies is also important so you can avoid any foods that are setting up an inflammatory response in your intestinal tract.</p>

                    <h3>Why can’t I just take Laxatives when I am Constipated?</h3>
                      <p>Remember that laxatives put chemicals into our body and just remove current waste. Your colon becomes lazy and then requires such stimulants to help your bowels to start peristalsis. Your bowel becomes dependent on them. Colon hydrotherapy is warm, filtered water which can soften and remove months to years of old metabolic waste material. Also, we can put slightly cooler water in during the discharge cycle to allow your colon to tone back up. Since it has taken years to get to such a point of chronic constipation it can’t be expected to clear up with one session. Sessions of three or six is usually needed to see the wanted results. Remember, the dried debris on the glass or lasagna pan that needs time to soak in order to let go.</p>

                    <h3>Will I have an electrolyte imbalance?</h3>
                      <p>Your colon hydrotherapy session will be 45 minutes with 60 minutes for the whole appointment. Research has shown changes in the electrolyte balance when colon sessions last one hour and twenty minutes so there is no danger of that. Putting a pinch of sea salt in your purified water that you drink on a daily basis will help you maintain a good mineral base and help the water absorb better into your body’s cells.</p>

                    <h3>Is it Ok to Have This Treatment at the Time of my Menstrual Period?</h3>
                      <p>Yes. This is a good time to have colon hydrotherapy as your body has already started a cleansing process. In fact, many women report more movement of the colon at this time so your session will help this process along.</p>

                    <h3>Can I file this on insurance?</h3>
                      <p>We do not bill insurance, but we will provide you with a receipt upon request. We are not a Medicare provider. We will charge your credit card prior to your appointment when we talk on the phone. You can check with your insurance company if you are under the care of a gastroenterologist who has prescribed the procedure for a colonoscopy prep to see if they will cover the session.</p>

                    <h3>What is Your Cancellation Policy?</h3>
                      <p>Integrated Body Health requires 48-hour postponement notice for new clients and 24 hours for already established clients. The charge will be applied to your next re- appointment. As a reminder, we call or text according to your preference one day before your appointment to confirm the date and time so you won’t forget. However, appointments are considered confirmed when the appointment is scheduled.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">What the Research Says</h3>
                      <p>1. An article from the American Cancer Society on colorectal cancer reads – “it is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered separately, and the second leading cause when both sexes are combined. Overall, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 20 (5%). The death rate from colorectal cancer has been dropping in both men and women for more than 20 years. There are a number of likely reasons for this. One is that polyps are being found by screening and removed before they can develop into cancers. Screening is also allowing more colorectal cancers to be found earlier when the disease is easier to cure.” There is now increasing use of colon hydro-therapy for colonoscopy preps by the gastroenterologist. As the colon is cleaner, it can be seen by the physician. When he sees the actual colon tissue, instead of debris, then polyps and any kind of abnormal tissue can actually be seen. Any needed intervention such as a biopsy or removal can then take place. Many clients can’t tolerate the normal bowel prep, so they stop taking all that is prescribed and go in to the test with a dirty colon. Usually the doctor and staff figure this out when they are already into the procedure.</p>
                      <p>2. From the Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology in an article titled “Epidemiology and Burden of Chronic Constipation” it is reported that constipation affects up to 27% of the population. “Constipation is physically and mentally troublesome for many patients, and can significantly interfere with their daily living and well-being. Although only a proportion of patients with constipation seek medical care, most of them use prescribed or over-the-counter medication to improve their condition. The health care costs of constipation are significant as evidenced by the hundreds of million dollars spent yearly on laxatives alone.”     It further states “Chronic constipation is an important component of clinical gastroenterology practice worldwide. Based on the definition, either self-reported or using Rome criteria, chronic constipation can affect from 2% to 27% of the population. Because constipation is more common in older patients and life expectancy is increasing, an increase in the prevalence of constipation is expected in the years to come, with the associated impact on quality of life and socioeconomic burden. Functional gastrointestinal diseases (FGIDs), including chronic constipation (CC), are among the most frequent illnesses seen by gastroenterologists and account for up to one-half of patient care time. CC is a remarkably common and costly condition that can negatively impact the quality of life, and result in a major social and economic burden.” More can be read at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206560.</p>
